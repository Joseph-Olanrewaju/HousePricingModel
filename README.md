### Project Title:
Predictive Modeling of House Prices Using Python (ML Regression Model)

### Overview:
This project involved building a machine learning model to predict the price of houses based on several key features, including living area, number of rooms, and the year the property was built.

### Project Highlights:

- Used Python and libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

- Performed thorough feature engineering and data cleaning, retaining impactful variables such as YearBuilt to reflect temporal market value influences.

- Trained a regression model (Linear Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost depending on what you used) to accurately predict house prices.

- Implemented logic that considers property age — for instance, two homes with identical sizes may have different values depending on the year built. A 2,459 sqft house built in 2010 is logically priced higher than one from 1980 due to updated construction standards, modern design, and market perception.

Why YearBuilt Was Not Dropped:
Rather than exclude YearBuilt during preprocessing (as some might), I kept it in recognition of its strong correlation with price. Homes built more recently tend to command higher values, reflecting better amenities, energy efficiency, and buyer preferences — insights that enhance model accuracy.

### Tools & Technologies Used:

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- Pandas, NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib / Seaborn

- Machine Learning (Regression Models)

Value Delivered:
This project equips property analysts, real estate platforms, and individual buyers with a tool to evaluate property prices accurately — supporting smarter, data-driven decisions.
