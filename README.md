About the analysis: 
The House price prediction was done to predict the price of any house selected by a prospective potential buyer, 
I decided not to drop "YearBuilt" as it might possibly affect the price of any house as the year goes by; 
By implication a house of 2459 SquareFeet by size Built in 2010,  should cost more than the same house Built in 1980 and cost less or more in 2015.
